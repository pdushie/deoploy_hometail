          Your privacy is important to us. It is APP_NAME&apos;s policy to
          respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you
          across our website, app, and other sites we own and operate.
          <br />
          <br />
          APP_NAME is committed to maintaining the privacy and anonymity of all
          users. We do not collect any personal patient information such as
          health card numbers, names, addresses, or any other identifying
          details. All interactions with the app are conducted anonymously to
          ensure the confidentiality of patient data. Any data used within
          APP_NAME is aggregated and anonymized, with no direct links to
          individual patients. Our commitment is to safeguard privacy by
          ensuring that only non-identifiable information is processed by the
          app.
          <br />
          <br />
          We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide
          a service to you. We collect this information by fair and lawful
          means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why
          we&apos;re collecting it and how it will be used.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can sign up with your Google account, which will prefill your
          APP_NAME account username with your name and public profile picture.
          <br />
          <br />
          We retain collected information only as long as necessary to provide
          you with your requested service. What data we store, we&apos;ll
          protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss, theft,
          and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
          <br />
          <br />
          We do not share any personally identifying information publicly or
          with third parties, except when required to by law.
          <br />
          <br />
          APP_NAME acts as a data controller and data processor regarding the
